# megaline_plans_ML
Machine Learning first project 
Mobile company Megaline is dissatisfied with the fact that many of its customers are using legacy plans. They want to develop a model that can analyze customer behavior and recommend one of Megaline's new plans: Smart or Ultra.

You have access to behavioral data from subscribers who have already switched to the new plans (from the Statistical Data Analysis sprint project). For this classification task, you must create a model that chooses the correct plan. Since you've already completed the data processing step, you can jump right into creating the model.

Develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. In this project, the accuracy threshold is 0.75. Use the dataset to check the accuracy.
